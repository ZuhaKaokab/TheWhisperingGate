  textContent: "The Whispering Gate\n\nLocal stories claimed this place was once
    a passage a bridge between two worlds. I dismissed it as superstition until I
    reached the clearing. There, hanging from a dead, brittle branch, were small
    figures made of straw and bone. Voodoo dolls. Dozens of them. They swayed gently,
    though the air was perfectly still.\n\nIf anyone else reads this, remember one
    thing:\nCuriosity is the first step this place uses to pull you in.\nThe second
    step\u2026\nis silence."
