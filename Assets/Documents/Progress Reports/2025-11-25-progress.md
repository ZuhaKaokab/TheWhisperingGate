# Progress Report – 25 Nov 2025

## Systems Implemented
- **Dialogue runtime**: `GameState`, `DialogueManager`, ScriptableObject data models, command/impact handling, event broadcasting.
- **UI layer**: `DialogueUIPanel` rewritten for TextMeshPro, typewriter effect, dynamic choice buttons, fade transitions.
- **Interaction + gameplay**: `DialogueTrigger`, `InventoryManager`, and a hybrid `PlayerController` supporting FP/TP modes with smooth camera follow.
- **Testing utilities**: Harness scripts for GameState, Dialogue, and Inventory to validate functionality via hotkeys.

## Documentation & Guides
- Created `SETUP-AND-TEST-GUIDE.md` describing step-by-step scene setup, harness usage, and troubleshooting.
- Added progress folder plus this summary for tracking milestones.

## Next Recommended Steps
1. Build out actual dialogue content (nodes/trees) per master design doc.
2. Integrate inventory UI and visual polish.
3. Consider editor tooling (Dialogue Editor Window) once runtime remains stable.
4. Begin writing automated play-mode tests for regression coverage.

Everything listed above is committed in-source and ready for team review.
