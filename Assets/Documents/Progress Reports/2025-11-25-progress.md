# Progress Report – 25 Nov 2025

## Systems Implemented
- **Dialogue runtime**: `GameState`, `DialogueManager`, ScriptableObject data models, command/impact handling, event broadcasting.
- **UI layer**: `DialogueUIPanel` rewritten for TextMeshPro, typewriter effect, dynamic choice buttons, fade transitions.
- **Interaction + gameplay**: `DialogueTrigger`, `InventoryManager`, and a hybrid `PlayerController` supporting FP/TP modes with smooth camera follow.
- **Testing utilities**: Harness scripts for GameState, Dialogue, and Inventory to validate functionality via hotkeys.
- **Impact Notifications**: `ImpactNotificationUI` for displaying choice impacts with animations and custom messages.
- **Stats Panel**: `StatsPanelUI` for real-time player stat display (courage, trust, sanity, investigation).

## Documentation & Guides
- Created `SETUP-AND-TEST-GUIDE.md` describing step-by-step scene setup, harness usage, and troubleshooting.
- Created `IMPACT-AND-STATS-UI-SETUP.md` with comprehensive setup instructions for impact notifications and stats panel.
- Created `DIALOGUE-EDITOR-TEST-GUIDE.md` for testing the dialogue editor window.
- Created `TEST-DIALOGUE-CONTENT.md` with sample dialogue data for testing.
- Created `HOW-NODES-WORK-IN-TREES.md` explaining dialogue node architecture.
- Added progress folder plus this summary for tracking milestones.

## Recent Updates (Latest Session)
- **Impact Notification System**: Implemented UI for displaying temporary notifications when choices have impacts (e.g., "Courage +10", "He will remember that").
- **Stats Panel UI**: Created real-time stat display panel with toggle functionality.
- **Event Integration**: Added `OnImpactApplied` and `OnItemGiven` events to DialogueManager for loose coupling.
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed duplicate event/method declarations in DialogueManager and DialogueUIPanel.

## Next Recommended Steps
1. Build out actual dialogue content (nodes/trees) per master design doc.
2. Polish inventory UI and visual design.
3. Continue refining Dialogue Editor Window functionality.
4. Begin writing automated play-mode tests for regression coverage.
5. Create 15-minute playable prologue with full dialogue integration.

Everything listed above is committed in-source and ready for team review.
