## CURSOR AI WORKFLOW

### Session 1: Training & Research (1-2 hours)

```
You: Paste CURSOR-AI-TRAINING-PROMPT.md

Cursor: "I'm ready to learn. What should I research?"

You: "Please research all topics in Phase 2. 
      Summarize best practices for each topic."

Cursor: [Spends 1-2 hours researching and summarizing]

You: "Great. Now read MASTER-DESIGN-DOCUMENT.md 
     and summarize the game vision, systems, and requirements."

Cursor: [Reads and summarizes the entire design document]

You: "Perfect. You're trained. Let's start generating code tomorrow."
```

### Session 2-7: Code Generation (Days 1-7)

**Day 1 Morning:**
```
You: "Generate GameState.cs following these requirements: [from MASTER-DESIGN-DOCUMENT]
     Apply SOLID principles. Include tests."

Cursor: [Generates complete, documented GameState code + test cases]

You: Review code using code review checklist
You: Suggest refinements if needed
Cursor: Refactor and improve

Result: Production-ready GameState.cs
```

**Day 2:**
```
Same workflow for DialogueManager.cs, DialogueUIPanel.cs, etc.
```

**Days 3-5:**
```
Same workflow for PlayerController.cs, InventoryManager.cs, etc.
```

**Days 6-7:**
```
Request Dialogue Editor Window generation
Use DIALOGUE-EDITOR-WINDOW-SPEC.md for detailed requirements
Cursor generates professional editor code
```

### Follow-up Sessions: Content & Polish

**Days 8-15:**
- Teams creates content using editor
- Testing and integration
- Bug fixes and optimization
- Defense preparation

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

✅ **Understand complete vision first** - MASTER-DESIGN-DOCUMENT.md is your map  
✅ **Train Cursor AI properly** - CURSOR-AI-TRAINING-PROMPT.md is comprehensive  
✅ **Follow roadmap exactly** - IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md is your daily checklist  
✅ **Use testing checklist** - INTEGRATION-CHECKLIST.md prevents bugs  
✅ **Reference for defense** - ARCHITECTURE-REFERENCE.md explains your design  

---

## WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

### Traditional Approach (Most FYP Projects):
- "Build a dialogue system" → Vague
- Copy code from tutorial → Inconsistent quality
- No architecture → Hard to extend
- Team confused → Communication breakdown
- Defense unprepared → Weak explanation

### Your Approach (With These 9 Documents):
- ✅ Crystal clear vision (MASTER-DESIGN-DOCUMENT)
- ✅ Professional architecture (ARCHITECTURE-REFERENCE)
- ✅ AI generates production code (CURSOR-AI training)
- ✅ Team knows exactly what to do (ASSET-AUTHORING-GUIDE)
- ✅ Daily execution plan (IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP)
- ✅ Testing prevents bugs (INTEGRATION-CHECKLIST)
- ✅ Defense explanation ready (ARCHITECTURE-REFERENCE)

## BY DECEMBER 11, YOU WILL HAVE

✅ Complete dialogue system with branching narrative  
✅ Character controller with smooth first-person movement  
✅ Inventory system with UI display  
✅ Professional editor window for content creation  
✅ 30+ dialogue nodes across 3 scenes  
✅ 15-minute playable prologue  
✅ Multiple ending paths based on player choices  
✅ Clean, documented, professional-quality code

## FINAL NOTES

**This is not a template.** Every line is specific to your game, your timeline, and your FYP requirements.

**This is not generic advice.** Every document maps to actual implementation steps with concrete code and architecture.

**This is not theoretical.** Every system has been thought through, designed to SOLID principles, and mapped to professional game development patterns.

**You have 16 days.** The roadmap fills every hour with clear tasks and checkpoints.

**You have everything you need.** No vague theory, no hallucinations, no guesswork.
